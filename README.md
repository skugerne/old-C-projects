# old-C-projects
Some C code from as early as 2000, maybe it should live again.

This stuff depends on SDL 1.x, with SDL_ttf generally and one project even wants SDL_net although it doesn't use it for much of anything.

The most interesting project is "roids" but its pretty painfully pure C (well, with C++ bits).  It has run on Windows, OSX and Linux.  Could use some high-level abstraction so that it could become more feature-complete.
